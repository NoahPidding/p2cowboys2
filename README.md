# Scrum Board Overview
[Scrum Board](https://github.com/awtung/p2-cowboys/projects/1)

Our scrum board consists of several columns in which we record our overall team goals, as well as weekly assignments for individuals (tickets). The scrum master (Aiden) tracks the progress made by the group as a whole, and logs whether something may still be in progress, or whether it has been completed.

Our group is going with a website with the features similar to those of popular social media apps, including instagram and facebook, where we are going to attempt to allow users to upload images onto our website so they can be shared. Also we may attempt to add some sort of chat feature, where users are able to chat with one another while on our website. This is just a start, and we will probably have to come up with more features that would be a good fit for our website, as these current features mentioned 

# Week 1 
## Team Goals (Week 1)
1) Come up with a project idea for the trimester, which we all agree on and invloves growth
